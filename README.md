The exponential rise of e-commerce has created a parallel surge in product returns, estimated to be worth
$816 billion in 2022 in the U.S. alone [1]. Traditional return processes are financially costly and
environmentally damaging, with many items ultimately ending up in landfills, contributing to carbon
emissions and wasted resources. Studies show that nearly 80% of returned goods are discarded rather
than resold or recycled.
This project proposes a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform to help small-scale online businesses manage
reverse logistics more effectively and sustainably. By integrating automation, analytics, and
sustainability-driven disposition options such as refurbishment, donation, and recycling, the system will
reduce waste-to-landfill and support circular economy
